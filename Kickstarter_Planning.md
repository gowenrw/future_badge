## Story

* Detailed project Description
```
Future Badge by @alt_bier and team
The Future Badge is a wearable piece of electronic art manufactured in the style of a conference badge themed for the DEFCON 31 conference.   This style of wearable art is known as #Badgelife by collectors.
This badge will have the following features: an ESP32 controller, at least 16 LEDs including 4 neopixels, capacitive touch, awesome artwork, hackable Arduino code, two interconnected PCBs, custom lanyard, and more.
The DEFCON 31 conference will take place in Las Vegas, NV from Aug 9-13 2023 and has a theme of "The Future Will Prevail" which is what we based this badge on.  You can find out more about this conference here https://defcon.org/
This badge will have a Back to the Future look complete with a DeLorean transitioning into time (flames and lightning effects) presented in a unique dual PCB design that showcases the art on the top PCB hiding the electronics in a secondary attached back PCB.
This will be @alt_bier's 9th #Badgelife creation.  But, this will be the first time you can pledge to sponsor one of these creations and guarantee you get one (all past @alt_bier #Badgelife was sold in person).  You can find links to his past creations here https://altbier.us/
We have started the design work for this project and are progressing quickly to production.  But, we need your help to make this badge a reality!

Sponsors who pledge for one of the badge reward tiers will receive an electronic ticket that can be used to pick up their badge at on of the distributions points.  It is a sponsors responsibility to pick up their badge as any unclaimed badges after the last distribution will be considered a starving hacker donation and will be given away.
There will be a minimum of Five badge distributions, two in the DFW area prior to DEFCON at three in Las Vegas during DEFCON.  We may add additional distributions if needed.

* Risks and Challenges
  * The main risk with designing a product like this is that the circuit does not perform as intended.  We intend to mitigate this risk with a small run of prototypes to fully test and tweak the design prior to the larger production manufacturing run.
