# Welcome

Welcome to the future badge website/repository.

This is where you will find all the details and files and instructions related to my DC31 future badge #badgelife.

The idea for this badge came from the DEFCON 31 theme: "The Future Will Prevail".
This theme made me think of the Back to the Future movies and the famous time traveling DeLorean.

This badge is mostly being provided as a DIY solder kit with a small quantity being provided fully assembled.
If you are looking for instructions on how to assemble the kit then you have come to the right place.

I hope that everyone who gets one of these badges enjoys it.  It was made with love for everyone in the community to enjoy.  And as with all my badges, it is all open hardware/software with all files provided in this repository.  So, if you didn't have a chance to get one of these kits at the con you can always make your own.
