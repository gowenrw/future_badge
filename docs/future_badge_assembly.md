## Soldering Steps

These are the assembly steps that require soldering.
I have presented them in the order I recommend they be implemented for best results.

Still working on this, check back soon.

## Additional Assembly Steps

These are the additional assembly steps that do not require soldering.
I have presented them in the order I recommend they be implemented for best results.
