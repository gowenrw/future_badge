# Crowdfunding Planning

Notes about Crowdfunding planning.

## Which Platform

Kickstarter vs Indigogo

Both have similar features.  However, kickstarter seems to have several built in delays.

Both require funding identity verification but kickstarter has a 1-3 business day review period before launch.

Going to set up on both platforms and fastest to be ready to launch will win.

Update: Indigogo won!

## Story

* Detailed project Description
```
  Future Badge by @alt_bier and team
  The Future Badge is a wearable piece of electronic art manufactured in the style of a conference badge themed for the DEFCON 31 conference.   This style of wearable art is known as #Badgelife by collectors.

  Product Details
  This badge will have the following features: an ESP32 controller, at least 14 LEDs including 4 NeoPixels, capacitive touch, awesome artwork, hackable Arduino code, two interconnected PCBs, custom lanyard, and more.

  The DEFCON 31 conference will take place in Las Vegas, NV from Aug 9-13 2023 and has a theme of "The Future Will Prevail" which is what we based this badge on.  You can find out more about this conference here https://defcon.org/

  This badge will have a Back to the Future look complete with a DeLorean transitioning into time (flames and lightning effects) presented in a unique dual PCB design that showcases the art on the top PCB hiding the electronics in a secondary attached back PCB.

  There will be puzzles included on the badge to be solved including a crypto challenge (code breaking, not coin mining!) and something that makes use of the embedded wireless.

  Hackable
  The badge will be programmed with Arduino code making it easily hackable by anyone wishing to reprogram it to do different things.

  The ESP32 on the badge has an embedded wireless controller that can be programmed for a variety of uses beyond the capture the flag puzzle we are planning to include.

  Collectable
  As with most #Badgelife creations this badge will be a collectable.  Given the limited quantity and demand these badges can retain their value and more years later.

  This will be @alt_bier's 9th #Badgelife creation.  But, this will be the first time you can pledge to sponsor one of these creations and guarantee you get one (all past @alt_bier #Badgelife was sold in person).  You can find links to his past creations here https://altbier.us/

  What We Need
  We have started the design work for this project and are progressing quickly to production.

  We need to raise funds in order to purchase all the components and have the PCB's manufactured.

  We need your help to make this badge a reality!

  Progress
  You can see the progress being made by viewing the weekly Twitch live streamed design sessions here https://www.twitch.tv/alt_bier_hacker

  You can see the complete history of this project from concept to current with the past stream sessions available for viewing in the Future Badge Diary playlist on YouTube here https://www.youtube.com/@alt_bier_hacker

  What Sponsors Will Get
  Sponsors who pledge for any of the reward tiers will be afforded the opportunity to opt-in to having their name or handle listed on the badge project website as a sponsor of the badge. 

  Sponsors who pledge for one of the badge reward tiers will receive an electronic ticket that can be used to pick up their badge at on of the distributions points.

  There are two products being offered as rewards to badge tier sponsors based on the sponsorship level.  The first is a Future Badge Kit that will require DIY soldering and assembly.  The second is a fully assembled ready to wear Future Badge.

  It is a sponsors responsibility to pick up their reward badge at a distribution point.  Any unclaimed badges after the last distribution will be considered a starving hacker donation and given away.  There will be no shipping.

  Sponsor Reward Distribution
  There will be a minimum of Five badge distributions, two in the DFW area prior to DEFCON and three in Las Vegas during DEFCON.  We may add additional distributions if needed.  

  The locations, dates and times of the initial badge distributions are below with any changes or additions being announced and kept up to date to allow sponsors to plan their pickup.

* Risks and Challenges
  * The main risk with designing a product like this is that the circuit does not perform as intended.  We intend to mitigate this risk with a small run of prototypes to fully test and tweak the design prior to the larger production manufacturing run.

* FAQ
  * Can I have my reward shipped If I cannot make it to one of the sponsor reward distributions?
    * No. We are not staffed to handle shipping in quantity.  It is the sponsors responsibility to pick up their reward badge at one of the distributions.  And reward badges not picked up after the last distribution will be considered forfeit by the sponsors and these badges will be given away to random DEFCON attendees.
  * What can the badge do?
    * The badge will perform various light displays that can be changed using the capacitive touch panels on the car.  It will also make use of the onboard WiFi for a puzzle in some way to be determined.  It will be programmed using Arduino code and thus can be reprogrammed to do whatever you would like within the limitations of the hardware.
